# About Migaloo

Migaloo is a private search engine for all your personal stuff.  It's like
having your own personal Google which knows about all of your stuff across
all of your accounts and devices:

  - phones
  - email
  - cloud accounts
  - laptops and desktops

## Connect Any Data Source

Migaloo lets you create your own custom search engines from lots of different
data sources, so you can index and search all of your favourite web sites.

Migaloo will even index private websites (like a Company Intranet), or shared
network drives and folders.

## Migaloo Marketplace

Some popular sites already have their own publicly available data source which
you can just enable in Migaloo:

  - Companies House
  - London Gazette
  - UK Government (gov.uk)
  - Scottish Government (gov.scot)

This list is expanding all the time.

Some of the data sources are highly specialised and may need a subscription.

## How does it work?

Migaloo is a fork from the well-known [searx] [metasearch engine] which was
inspired by the [Seeks project].  It provides basic privacy by mixing your
queries with searches on other platforms without storing search data.  Migaloo
can be added to your browser's search bar; moreover, it can be set as the
default search engine.

The {{link('stats page', 'stats')}} contains some useful anonymous usage
statistics about the engines used.

## How can I make it my own?

Migaloo appreciates your concern regarding logs, so take the code from the
[Migaloo sources] and run it yourself!

Add your instance to this [list of public
instances]({{get_setting('brand.public_instances')}}) to help other people
reclaim their privacy and make the internet freer.  The more decentralized the
internet is, the more freedom we have!
